                <p>
                    Mark Zuckerberg has influenced my ambition to build a career around software development, due to his success from Facebook. I was inspired by the fact he started Facebook from his dorm room with his friends. He added a lot of features to Facebook, making
                    it user-friendly so even children could grasp all of the functions. I am especially interested in the development of the software from just being able to post comments and photographs to now being able to browse local news feeds, produce
                    live videos, arrange events, send messages to friends, request suggestions, and buy and sell goods. I have consistently been intrigued by Facebook's constant innovations throughout my life, as well as their development of other social
                    media platforms, such as Instagram. Mark's work inspires me to learn how to develop software myself, as well as how to handle customers' data from all around the world. Consequently, I seek to acquire practical software knowledge and
                    abilities, and aspire to become a software engineer in the future.

                    When I first learned I had outstanding technological talents, it was a turning point for me. I was wondering why there were so many different applications on the screen when I received a phone or laptop from my parents, so I began to study them all attentively.
                    Some programs were appealing, while others were tedious to use. After researching, I discovered that software was a set of instructions that enabled all of the programs on my phone and laptop to function. Therefore, on weekends, I
                    began to self-teach some of the software systems. I have since become familiar with the fundamentals of several programming languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, I am really excited to begin studying "Software Engineering Technician course" in preparation for a job in industry. I want to be a skilled programmer and a coder that can solve problems. And I sincerely hope that in the future, I will be
                    able to secure my first entry-level job in my subject of study. And I can not wait to put my full talent to work in class and in industry to expand my knowledge and experience.
